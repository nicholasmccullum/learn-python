# Welcome to my Introduction to Python course!

You can access the course homepage [here.](https://nickmccullum.com/python-course/)

This repository has the accompanying files for each practice problem section. To open them, you'll need to have [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) installed on your computer. You can read my tutorial on how to install Jupyter using the Anaconda distribution [here](https://nickmccullum.com/python-course/how-to-install-anaconda/).

## Happy coding!
